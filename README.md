## About La La Lead

La La Lead can be used as a starting point to develop subscription funnels (typically, landing pages that invite users to leave their contacts, for call me back services, etcetera).
Being developed with Laravel and Bootstrap, it offers a well structured, solid and secure basic environment for your project.

## Requirements

- Apache
- Mysql
- Php 8.1

Since Laravel is database agnostic, it will be quite easy to switch to another DBMS (Postgres, etcetera) in case you need.

## Installation

Pull from this repository, then launch 
<pre>
composer install
php artisan migrate
</pre>

and you should be fine.

To start local server, launch
<pre>php artisan serve</pre>

Enjoy and feel free to change the code as you need :)
